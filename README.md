# COVIData


Bryan Denq, Olu Barbar, Sulman Choudhary, Kristina Mulholland

## Description:  
We will investigate relationships between Covid-19, mask mandates and select respiratory, close contact, and blood borne illnesses.  


## Research Questions:

~How did Covid-19 epidemic affect the selected disease groups (respiratory, close contact, blood borne)?

~What is the relationship between Covid rates and length of Mask Mandates?
~How did Covid epidemic affect respiratory infections (Flu)?

~How did Covid epidemic affect close contact, non respiratory infections (E. Coli)?

~How did Covid epidemic affect blood borne infections (Lyme Disease)?


~What is the relationship between Covid infection rates and infection rates of other diseases (respiratory, contact, blood borne)?
