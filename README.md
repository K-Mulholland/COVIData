# COVIData


Bryan Denq, Olu Barbar, Sulman Choudhary, Kristina Mulholland

## Description:  
We will investigate relationships between Covid-19 and select respiratory, close contact, and blood borne illnesses.  


## Research Questions:

~How did Covid-19 epidemic affect the selected disease groups (respiratory, close contact, blood borne)?


~How did Covid epidemic affect respiratory infections (Pertussis & Flu)?

~How did Covid epidemic affect close contact, non respiratory infections (E. Coli & Meningitis)?

~How did Covid epidemic affect blood borne infections (Lymes Disease & Hepatitis)?


~What is the relationship between mask protocols and infection rates (respiratory, contact, blood borne)?
